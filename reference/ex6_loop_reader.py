"""
As we saw in the previous exercise, the DictReader gives us a dict for each row when you call `.next()`

The `for` loop automatically picks up on the `.next()` (an iterable) so you can inspect each row in the file
until it reaches the end

We can use a variable to count the number of loops, and that will give us the total number of rows in the file

    for row in reader:

        # += is the same are writing `count = count + 1`
        #
        count += 1
